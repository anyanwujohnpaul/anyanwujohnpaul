# Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Johnpaul Anyanwu

## Software Engineer

My name is Johnpaul, and I am a Software Engineer who is deeply passionate about backend development. I love the feeling of building systems that actually keep products running and make technology work the way people expect it to.

My journey into tech has not been the typical one. I explored different programming languages from Python to JavaScript before finding where I truly feel at home. Backend engineering gives me a sense of focus and discipline. It teaches me patience, attention to detail, and how to think clearly when solving problems that users never even see.

I show up every day to learn something new about systems, servers, databases, architecture, and everything that makes applications scalable and reliable. I want to be world-class at what I do and I am committed to putting in the work it takes to get there.

Outside of code, you will likely find me at tech meetups, speaking to people, listening to music, or imagining big ideas about the future.
